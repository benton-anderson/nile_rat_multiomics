Must use the CD33 output with all necessary columns present. 
Column order from CD output does not matter ... probably... I hope... 
Must use .csv file that was converted from excel file. 
Cannot write converted file to a different directory. 
.csv file must not be open in Excel or else conversion will fail. 

Open command prompt and change directory to where aligned file lives.
Your python might be one of the following commands: py, python, python3, py3
Requires python > 3.2

Arguments: 
-f or --file = your aligned or unaligned file name (can also be path/to/file)
-a or --aligned = flag for aligned file
-u or --unaligned = flag for unaligned file
If you mix-up -a or -u on your file, then converter will fail with message like:
	"ValueError: 'Name' is not in list" or "ValueError: 'Ion' is not in list".
-o or --outfilename = OPTIONAL. Name for converted file. 
If -o argument not used, defaults to appending "_CD33converted" to original name.

Try these examples with the included files in the folder! 

py CD33_lipidex_converter.py -f test_file_CD33_aligned.csv -a -o my_converted_file.csv
Writes file named "my_converted_file.csv". 

py CD33_lipidex_converter.py -f test_file_CD33_unaligned.csv -u
Writes file named "unaligned_file_CD33converted.csv" 
Note the default ending was appended to original filename.
